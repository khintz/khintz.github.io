Welcome to my personal website. I am a scientific researcher at the [Danish Meteorological Institute](https://www.dmi.dk/). My research focuses on the use of crowdsourced data for numerical weather prediction.

I am focused on implementing ways of maintaining, improving and deploying code through the use of continuous integration and continuous deployment.

I am also interested in the use of machine learning for weather forecasting.
